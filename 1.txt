That's how I ended up in this world of my own creation, with a classmate of mine that I  was all too familiar with. [r]
But there's a background to all this that you ought to know.[r]
Or rather, it's a background that I ought to write about, if I at least want to get this feeling of guilt off my chest. [r]
When I was 8 years old, my Father moved abroad to England, and I naturally went with him. My Mother had died before I was old enough to know her, so I had no choice but to go with him; he was my legal guardian.[r]
If I did have a choice back then, I probably wouldn't have went. [r]
Up until that point, I had lived in Japan all my life. From the ages of 3 to 5, I was homeschooled. [hrs]
By the age of 6, it was mandatory for me to be enrolled in a school, and that's exactly  what my Father did with me. I spent two years at a elementary school for rich kids in  Tokyo.

I should probably clarify that my Father was a CEO for a large car manufacturing company; one of the biggest in Japan in fact. [r]
He was a...  My Father was a cold and distant man. I never really saw him all that much around the house during my childhood. [r]
He always got a babysitter to take care of me, and every couple of months, that babysitter would be swapped out with another one (I never understood the reason for this). [r]
I found it quite difficult to make any friends at this school. And in fact, now that I think about it, I don't think I was ever able to make any friends after that. [r]
What you need to understand about me is that I'm a coward through and through. [r]
I found it impossible to interact with the other children at that school. I was too much of a  cowardly weakling to do anything. [hrs]
I was petrified of the teachers and the other kids. The teachers tried to push me towards interacting with the other kids, but I froze up whenever they tried to talk to me. [r]

I don't need to write about this. Let's just move on to talking about when I moved to England. I think you've got a good enough idea of what my life was like before I moved. [r]
At age 8, my Father emigrated to England, and I went with him. [r]
He enrolled me in a well-to-do Catholic school for the children of wealthy parents. [r]
It might've been the most prestigious school in the country (it's name escapes me). [r]
I already had a difficult time interacting with other children in Japan, so you can only imagine how difficult it was for me to interact with kids who spoke a completely different language to me. [r]
I'd spent most of my childhood learning my Mother tongue, Japanese, so I had no knowledge of English whatsoever. [hrs]
I couldn't communicate with anyone at that school. I was given my own private tutor at this school who specialized in teaching young foreign children English.

The only thing that gave me comfort during this time was a fantasy book I had called "The Count of Sisley", which I read over and over again. [r]
Everything else about my time at that school was a blur.  [r]
Oh, I suppose there's one event I remember clearly. [r]
When I was twelve years old, our class went on a mandatory cross country trip.  [r]
I'd never heard of the activity before. I was told by my tutor that it was a long distance race of some sort. [r]
When the day of the event came, I was petrified. [r]
As the race began, all of the other kids ran ahead of me. I must've been a terrible runner. [r][hr repage=true]
Before I knew it, I was the only kid running. There was no one else around me. [r]
For some reason, that was my defining memory of my time at that school. [r]

At around this time, my Father had already come to the decision that we'd be moving back  to Japan. [r]
There was never a conversation about this. The first time I found out about this was from my private English tutor. [r]
My Father never communicated anything with me directly...  [r]
From everything I've heard about him via osmosis, my Father's chief concern as a parent was  with getting me enrolled in the best schools, so I could make something of myself and get  out of his hair for good. [r]
His orders were always relayed to me through some third-party, and usually those orders were just, "You're enrolling in this school."  [r]
And that would be it. [r][hr repage=true]
So around the time when I was on the verge of hitting thirteen, we moved back to Japan, and the order from above was that I'd be attending a fancy all-girls junior high school in Tokyo.[r]

Miyabe-san is... I don't know how to explain her. I'm not sure if I'm capable of writing something that will be poetic enough to match up to the beauty of her soul. [r]
Miyabe-san is the person I think about more than anyone. It's not an exaggeration to say that  our first meeting was maybe the most significant moment of my entire life.  [r]
It all took place at that all-girls junior high school. Nothing really changed for me when I moved to this school. [r]
Even though there was no longer a language barrier, I still felt incredibly flustered at the  idea of interacting with other people. [r]
Because of this, I was isolated and on my own for most of my time at this school.[hr repage=true]

Anyway, I was walking around the school with my nose planted firmly in a book that I had picked up from the library.  [r]
I was going down a flight of stairs, and I must have misjudged where my foot placement was relative to the step I was walking down, as my heel clipped one of the steps instead of landing on it perfectly. [r]
A sharp pain hit me all at once, my ankle went in a weird direction, and I had to catch  myself on the handrail. [r]
I collected myself in silence. At first, the pain went away, but when I tried to place a foot  down to continue down the stairs, a pain radiated in that foot. [r]
This might be difficult to believe, but I'd never broken or sprained anything before that.  [r][hr repage=true]
It's embarrassing for me to admit this, but I was fully intending on not telling anyone about my ankle. [r]
If I told them about my ankle, they'd question what I was doing, and then I'd have to tell  them.

I slowly made my way down the stairs using the handrail as a support. At the bottom of the stairs, I tried to walk in a way that would hide my limping. [r]
I was trying to make my way to the nearest seat.  [r]
As I was half-walking, half-limping, a girl suddenly marched up to me.  [r]
I didn't recognize her, but then again I very rarely looked at other people's faces, so that was only natural.  [r]
"Hey." That's what she said to me. My eyes darted from the floor, which is where I was putting all my concentration, towards the girl's face, and then I reflexively looked away  from her when I felt a spike of panic hit me. [r]
"What are you doing? You've hurt yourself, right? Come here." [r][hr repage=true]
The girl stepped brazenly into my personal space. I felt my heart beating in my ears. I don't  think I'd ever gotten this close to a person before. [r]
I tried to tell the girl, "I'm fine", but I ended up babbling this out incoherently. [r]
The girl turned her back to me and knelt down, saying "get on."  [r]

All I could do in that moment was stand there shaking. I'd never touched a stranger before, so the idea of hopping on to this girl's back was terrifying to me. [r]
The girl looked back at me in befuddlement. "Hurry up. Get on."  [r]
The words of the girl pushed me, and I timidly knelt down and hovered close to the girl,  not fully ready to hold on to her yet. [r]
The girl took the initiative and backed up into me, scooping up my legs, and lifting me into a piggyback. [r]
My hands automatically wrapped around the girl's shoulders, and suddenly I was hugging the  back of this complete stranger. [r]
Everything after that was a haze. The girl might have spoken to me while she carried me,  but whatever she said to me fell on deaf ears.  [r][hr repage=true]
It's unlikely that I did anything but murmur in response to her.

It was through the girl's conversation with the nurse that I learned her name: Miyabe Yuko. [r]
When Miyabe-san was done talking with the nurse she looked over at me, smiled, and waved.  [r]
To me, in that moment, Miyabe-san reminded me of a certain character from that fantasy book I was always reading as a kid. [r]
Up until that point, I'd thought that chivalrous people like the kind you see in fantasy stories didn't exist in reality.  [r]
But Miyabe-san had proved that assumption wrong. Before then, no one had ever gone out of their way to help me or care about me (not unless they were paid to do so by my Father). [r]
I'd never felt happier in my entire life. [r][hr repage=true]
For the rest of the time I spent in that infirmary, I couldn't stop thinking about Miyabe-san.  And even after I left the infirmary, I continued to think about her. [r]
Even now, I haven't forgotten about what Miyabe-san did for me that day. [r]

From that day onwards, whenever I would notice Miyabe-san walking around the school, my  gaze would immediately move towards her and not let go.  [r]
Despite everything, I was still too much of a coward to go up to her. The closer I got to her,  the more flustered I became, and so I settled on just observing her from afar. [r]
It was through these observations that I began to gain an understanding of the kind of person  Miyabe-san was. Like me, she was a loner. But while my reclusiveness was due to my  cowardness, with Miyabe-san, it was instead due to her being more of a lone wolf.  [r]
She kept to herself for most of the time. She had a habit of walking around the school by herself, and whenever she came across a person who needed help, she'd always help them. [hr repage=true]The way I saw her was like a lone Knight. [r]
But while she would help people, Miyabe-san would never do it for the sake of a reward or to make a friend. When a person she helped would try to get close to her, Miyabe-san would push them away. [r]

I couldn't help but think that she must have felt an affinity towards me. I was always by myself after all, just like her. Perhaps she took notice of that when she helped me. [r]
That's why she smiled and waved at me, and didn't do the same thing to all the other people she helped. I was not wrong to compare her to a character from a fantasy book.  [r]

For the rest of my time in junior high, I continued to watch Miyabe-san while fantasizing  about her. She was on my mind constantly. [r]
Before I knew it, my time as a junior high school student came to an end.  [r]
I was now sixteen and a high school student. There were many changes that came with high school. [r]
For one thing, I started to live on my own. While me and my Father technically lived in the same house during junior high, the house was so big that my Father had his own section of  the house cut-off from the rest of the house that was designated to me.  [r]
Now that I was sixteen, my Father realized that he no longer had to take me with him whenever he moved to another country, and so he left the country without me. [r][hr repage=true]
He left me with a letter that informed me that he was selling off the big house we were previously living in, and that I would now be living on my own in an apartment he paid for.
 He made sure to inform me in the letter that from here on out, I would be on my own. [r]

So I was now attending a high school in Tokyo. My biggest fear about leaving the old school behind was that I would no longer be able to see Miyabe-san anymore. [r]
I remember there being a couple of months where I was racked with fear over the thought  of never seeing her again. [r]
As luck would have it, not only did she end up attending the same all-girls high school with me, we also ended up in the same class. [r]
I was so happy that I couldn't help but fantasize about how I might finally work up the  courage to walk up to Miyabe-san and talk to her. [r]
Because me and Miyabe-san were in the same class, we also shared the same teachers for all  our subjects. [r]
The teacher most relevant to this story is our English teacher, Harada-sensei. [hrs]
Harada-sensei is not a good English teacher. He's really bad at his pronunciation.

If a student wanted to go on this field trip, they would have to get their legal guardian to sign a waiver that gave them permission to go. [r]
My Father had emigrated abroad and left me to live on my own, so I had no one who could  sign my waiver.  [r]
All of the other people in my class, including Miyabe-san, were able to get their parents to sign the waiver. [r]
Thus, I was the only one who didn't go on this field trip.  [r]
On the one hand, I'm not normally a fan of school trips. But on the other hand, I wouldn't have minded going if Miyabe-san was going too. [r]
Writing that I, "wouldn't have minded going" is probably putting it lightly. [r]
I really wish I could've went on that field trip. [hr repage=true]After the field trip happened, I never  stopped wishing that everything could go back to how things were before that field trip. [r]
If I went on that field trip, maybe everything wouldn't have went wrong.

While Miyabe-san was away with the entire class on a field trip, there was an incident. [r]
Well, the incident didn't happen, but it almost happened.[r]
The incident almost happened, but I used a hairpin to stab slash cut him.  [r]
The incident stopped there. [r]
It was the first time in my life that I'd ever done something proactively. It was like there was  another part of me that took over in that moment. [r]
I'm sorry. I don't know if I can write about this clearly. [r]
Let's just say that something bad almost happened to me, and I wished that Miyabe-san had  been there to protect me, but she wasn't. [r]
If she was there, she would've protected me. Of that, I'm certain.

For the rest of the week, I counted down the days until Miyabe-san returned.  [r]
I just wanted to see her again. Watching her help other people, while simultaneously pushing them away was one of the few things in life that gave me comfort.  [r]
It was an ever-present reminder of how special what we had was. [r]
I never saw Miyabe-san show a smile to any other person like she did for me back in that infirmary three years ago. [r]
That was until she returned from the school trip with the rest of the class. [r]
Something was wrong. Miyabe-san had changed. [r]
I suppose now is the time to write about Asami. [r]

Asami was a student that was in the same class as me and Miyabe-san.  [r]
Naturally, she went on the field trip with everyone as well. [r]
I had never took notice of this girl until after the class returned from the field trip. [r]
The girl had a strange hairstyle. She had a similar hair length to Miyabe-san, but there was  a chunk of hair missing from her fringe, as if she had personally cut her bangs herself. [r]
The reason I took notice of this girl was because Miyabe-san had suddenly changed as a person when she returned from this school trip. [r]
Miyabe-san was no longer the isolated, chivalrous, loner that I had observed her being for  the past three years. [r]
Instead, Miyabe-san now spent all of her time with this Asami girl and her friends. [r][hr repage=true]
It didn't make sense to me. [r]

Miyabe-san went from pushing people away, to suddenly embracing and smiling at all these strangers who had become her friends over the course of a week. [r]
That's not the only change that I noticed. For some reason, Miyabe-san was now constantly carrying around some kind of pink mini scrapbook with her.  [r]
Inside that mini scrapbook (which I had managed to catch a glimpse of from a distance) were photos of Miyabe-san, Asami, and all of the other girls that now surrounded them. [r]
I presume those photos were taken on that field trip. [r]
In addition to this, once Miyabe-san returned, she stopped strolling around the school by herself, dispensing her chivalry to everyone.  [r]
Instead, all of that chivalry was hogged by Asami. [r][hr repage=true]
How did she get Miyabe-san to change like this? [r]

It didn't feel good to watch Miyabe-san after that. [r]
The question of what happened on the field trip was on my mind constantly. [r]
There was also a worry that was starting to build up in me: [r]
"What if they get any closer than that?" [r]
There was a part of me that felt guilty for even thinking like this. [r]
I didn't even know what kind of person Asami was. [r]
And yet, I deeply resented her for changing Miyabe-san. [r]
"If only I wasn't like this. I'm the worst." That's often how I felt during this time. [r]

For the rest of the second term, I continued to observe Miyabe-san from afar, but even I found it difficult to keep an eye on her. [r]
She was constantly moving with Asami and the other girls, which made it difficult for me to see what she was doing most of the time. [r]
I continued to keep everything to myself. Ocassionally, I would vent and rant about Miyabe-san to myself when I was all alone in my house. [r]
That was the only way for me to keep going. [r]
Once the second term ended, the holidays came. [r]
It was impossible for me to observe Miyabe-san during the holidays, and so I spent most of  my time during this period reading and contemplating things by myself. [hrs]
After that, the third term arrived, and a certain English report would be the catalyst for  the creation of a story set in a strange world. [r]

Seeing Miyabe-san again after not seeing her for the holidays had a profound affect on me. [r]
For some reason, I felt a kind of determination build inside me that I had never felt before  when I saw her. [r]
I don't know why, but I had this overwhelming sensation like this third term would be my last chance to get close to Miyabe-san.  [r]
The time I spent wallowing in my own self-pity during the holidays gave me a clarity that I had never felt before.  [r]
All my life, I had been terrified to get close to people. And so, I was all alone. [r]
If things continued on like this, then I'd probably continue to be alone until the day I died.  No one would remember me. [r]
I know. It's ridiculous that I didn't come to this revelation before this point. [r]
But now it all felt incredibly dire to me.[hr repage=true] I had to let Miyabe-san know how I felt before it  was too late. [r]

Within the first week of the third term, the English teacher for our class gave us all a writing assignment. This assignment tasked us with writing a report in English on the topic, "what do you want to be in the future?"  [r]
We'd have to turn our reports in to Harada-Sensei on the deadline day, and then the next  day we would be presenting these reports to the rest of the class. [r]
While seemingly an innocuous topic at first, this report, combined with the revelation I had upon seeing Miyabe-san after the holidays, would be the two things that pushed me towards  writing a fantasy story. [r]
I was sitting at a table in my house with a blank piece of paper before me. I had a pen in my hand, and I was tapping the tip of it against the page. It was sometime in the evening.  [r][hr repage=true]
I was thinking about the report topic. At first, I couldn't think of what I wanted to be in  the future. The only thing that came to my mind was that I wanted to be with Miyabe-san,  but I knew that I couldn't possibly write that down and submit it as a report. [r]

I put everything into the story. Everything I felt, everything I saw, everything I loved, everything I desired, everything that defined who I was, everything I hated, everything that  inspired me, everything that scarred me; all of it was contained in the characters and the  story of that world. [r]
Naturally, this of course meant that my feelings for Miyabe-san were contained in this story  as well. [r]
I was influenced heavily by the fantasy story that I was always reading from my childhood. In fact, I'm not ashamed to admit that I may have lifted some concepts from that book directly.  [r]
But who cares? The story I was writing had more of me in it than anything.

At the end of the story, the protagonist would be surrounded by the characters she'd met along her journey.  [r]
A stone monument, representing the neverending war and perpetual conflict the world had  found itself in, would be torn down, and the protagonist would hold on to the ruby gem  that the Princess had used to initially summon her to this world and say the magic words. [r]
Once she did that, she'd be returned to her world, content in the knowledge that she had saved this strange world and helped all of the friends she made along the way. [r]
By the time I'd finished writing the story, it was six o'clock in the morning.  [r]
As I looked outside my window, I was surprised to see that the dawn sky was a strange mix  of pink, red, and blue. [r][hr repage=true]
That strange sight inspired me to title the story I'd written, "Strange Dawn." [r]
That title just felt right to me. [r]

What would I do with this story? I wasn't going to share it with the whole world. [r]
No, there was only one person who I wanted to read this story: Miyabe-san. [r]
I couldn't communicate my feelings to her directly, so this indirect method seemed much more ideal. [r]
This story I'd written was filled to the brim with allusions to my feelings for her. [r]
If Miyabe-san could see these allusions for what they are, if she could perceive the love for  her that I'd written into this work and embrace it, then she would love me in return. [hrs]
My plan was to give the Strange Dawn story to her at some point after she had presented her  English report to the rest of the class. [r]
My reason for this was that I first wanted to know what her aspirations for the future were. [r]
She had changed since the field trip, and I no longer felt like I knew who she was. [r]
I had to make sure that she was still the person I always thought she was.

Later, I wrote up a generic English report to use for the assignment. [r]
When the day of the report's deadline finally arrived, it didn't exactly go as I expected it to. [r]
Our first class of the day was English. Everyone handed their reports in to Harada-sensei,  with the exception of one person: Miyabe-san. [r]
Harada-sensei told her that she could still hand her report in tomorrow as long as she  dropped it off at the faculty office. [r]
This was a rather large wrench in my plan. I had no idea what I would do if Miyabe-san  didn't hand her report in for the assignment. [r]
Little did I know, that something even more strange would happen to me the very next day, as I would be hit with a series of curve balls. [r]

It was the 18th July 2000.  In fourth period, we had social studies. The English class where we were all going to be presenting our reports was slated for the final period of that day.  [r]
The first curve ball of the day came during this social studies class. The teacher had decided to split the class up randomly into groups of five, so they could go off into their own separate rooms to brainstorm for a class activity that we would do doing in the subsequent  social studies class. [r]
I was put into a group with three girls who I barely knew and, most importantly, Miyabe-san.  [r]
The other three girls in the group all knew each other, whereas me and Miyabe-san were the  outsiders of the group.  [r]
The three girls were quite talkative. [hr repage=true]They threw all kinds of questions at me and Miyabe-san in order to get to know us. [r]

In the past, I would've been completely incapable of uttering a single word to anyone. But  for some reason, ever since I'd written that Strange Dawn story, I no longer felt completely  crippled by my shyness, and I was able to respond to their questions without fretting. [r]
I even found myself capable of asking my own questions. I went further and asked Miyabe-san a question or two of my own, pulling her into the conversation [r]
I still wasn't perfect at communicating with others; I think I might've stuttered a bit, and I  sometimes ended up unintentionally rambling as I tried to think of the next thing to say. [r]

I told them about how I went to a foreign school in England when I was younger, about how  I was living on my own, and I even told them that I was a writer.  [r]
Miyabe-san had been feigning disinterest in the conversation up until that point, but she suddenly perked up when I said I was a writer.  [r]
She asked me what I was writing, and I panicked a little at this moment and stumbled over  my words. [r]
Fortunately, I was somehow able to collect myself together and tell her that I was writing a  fantasy story. [r]
The whole situation felt surreal. Never in all my life had I carried on a conversation this much. [r]

The three girls offered to go get lunch for all five of us. I tried to turn down the offer,  but the girls insisted. [r]
Miyabe-san had a grumpy expression on her face, as she said, "If you're insisting, then go ahead." [r]
That made me smile. It reminded me of how she used to push others away back in junior high. [r]
The other three girls left the room, leaving just me and Miyabe-san alone together. [r]
There was a long silence that followed this.  [r]
Eventually, I was able to work up the nerve to call out her name. "M-Miyabe-san." [r]
Miyabe-san looked at me blankly. [r]
For some reason, I said, "Um... Do you like to read books, Miyabe-san?" [r]
Miyabe-san shrugged and said, "Sometimes..." [r]

Feeling like I ought to test the waters a little, I asked Miyabe-san, "D-do you like fantasy  stories?" [r]
Miyabe-san shook her head and said, "Nah, I hate that kind of stuff. Fantasy stories are just  a means people use to escape from reality. I prefer to read books about stories that happen in  reality." [r]
My heart sank a little when I heard this, but I tried to not let it show on my face. "I-I  see." [r]
At that moment, there was a commotion outside of the room we were in.  [r]

When I came to, I was standing in a field of pale, yellowish grass. Directly in front of me was a stone monument that was reminiscent of... one of the Stonehenge arches? [r]
It was for this very reason that my first thought upon seeing this monument was that I was  back in England. [r]
Somewhat reflexively, I mumbled out the words, "where...", but before I could I finish my sentence, a much louder voice boomed right next to me. [r]
"What- What is this? What happened?" I looked to my right and was shocked to see that Miyabe-san was standing right next to me. [r]
"I... I... I don't know." is what I stuttered out in response, and that was the truth. At that point in time, I had no idea where I was. [r]
Miyabe-san jumped and snapped her head towards me. [hr repage=true]It seemed as though she had not  registered my presence until then. [r]
"Natsuno-san...? What's going on? Where are we?"

I turned around to look behind me, only to notice that there was a strange ring-shaped stone  monument directly behind us. The monument felt very familiar to me. [r]
Miyabe-san noticed my gaze, and turned around to look where I was looking. The two of us stared at the stone ring in silence for a moment. [r]
Both of us had our school bags with us. [r]
Suddenly, Miyabe-san let out a huff of frustration, crossed her arms, and pivoted away  from the monument. She then started to walk off. [r]
Taken aback by this, I called out to Miyabe-san and followed after her. [r]
"W-wait, Miyabe-san. Where are you going?" [r]
Miyabe-san didn't answer me. [r][hr repage=true]
As I caught up to Miyabe-san, I was able to take a glimpse at her expression. There was a look of something like panic or concern on her face, but she quickly covered that expression up with a more stoic one. [r]

For the next twenty minutes or so, we walked in silence. [r]
Eventually, the grassy plains gave way to a more rocky terrain. We also began to pass by multiple massive rock pillars that seemed to be natural rock formations in this land. [r]
I remembered how the story I wrote had big rock formations similar to this, but I was still unaware at this point of the true identity of this world. [r]
The silence between me and Miyabe-san had stretched on for so unbearably long that I felt  like I had to say something, and so I did. [r]
"Miyabe-san. Um..." [r]
Miyabe-san spoke up, "what?" causing me to fumble my words. [r]
"Uh... Um... Have you turned in the report for Harada-sensei's class?" [r][hr repage=true]
Up until the social studies class, that question had been on my mind the entire day.

Miyabe-san said, "nope" to this. Despite the situation we were in, I was more concerned in  that moment over the fact that Miyabe-san had not given in her report. [r]
I tried to reassure Miyabe-san that there was still time for her to give in her report to Harada-sensei, but Miyabe-san shut me down at that moment by revealing that she had not written her report. [r]
Upon hearing this, I was left confused at what my plan of action would be. Should I still  give the story I had written to Miyabe-san? Or was it best not to risk it and wait for a  better opportunity? [r]
Those questions swirled in my head as we continued to walk. [r]
Suddenly, I noticed a river in the distance and pointed it out to Miyabe-san. [r][hr repage=true]
I fumbled a bit in the conversation, but Miyabe-san eventually agreed with me, and we both  headed towards the river. [r]

I tried to mimic the girls from our class, but that didn't seem to work on Miyabe-san. [r]
It was here when Miyabe-san suddenly turned away from me. At first, I thought she'd  caught on to my act, but it turns out that this wasn't what made her turn. [r]
Miyabe-san abruptly stood up and said, "who's there?" [r]
There was a moment of silence. Concerned by this, I got out of the river and put my shoes and tights back on. [r]
Miyabe-san began running off without me, and so I chased after her. [r]
As Miyabe-san left the entrance leading to the river, she noticed small footsteps on the ground and knelt down to examine them. [r]
To me, they didn't look like the footprints of any animal I'd seen before. The truth of the situation hadn't fully set in for me yet.

Miyabe-san continued to march onwards in search of whatever caught her attention back at  the river, and I continued to trail behind her. [r]
Neither of us had openly discussed or even speculated about what kind of situation we were  in until this point. [r]
I felt like I had to get my own speculation off my chest, and so I told Miyabe-san that I think we might've ended up in some sort of parallel world. [r]
Miyabe-san told me that such a thing wasn't possible and seemed a little frustrated with me. [r]
That's when it happened. [r]
Out of nowhere, an extremely familiar creature ran into Miyabe-san and knocked her over. [r][hr repage=true]
Riding atop this familiar creature was an equally familiar tiny human. This was the moment  when I realized what world we were in. [r]
It was the world of the story I had written; the world of Strange Dawn. [r]

The tiny human who had been riding the glider (this is what I called these creatures in Strange Dawn), had been knocked off after running into Miyabe-san, and he now lay unconscious on the ground. [r]
Miyabe-san tried to reach out to the tiny human, which she misconstrued as a doll, and I  tried to warn her to be careful, but it was already too late. [r]
The tiny human perked up and began waving his sword at us. My mind was running a mile a minute, and I could barely tell what was going on anymore. [r]
Before we could do anything, Miyabe-san was pelted in the head by a small rock. We looked in the direction that the rock came from. [r]
There was a squadron of Baljidan troops there, all of them manning gliders. They fired out even more small rocks at us. [r][hr repage=true]
Miyabe-san and I used our school bags to shield ourselves and tried to run away.  [r]

We ran, but a glider chased after us. One of the tiny humans riding the glider hit  Miyabe-san in the leg with an arrow, causing her to collapse to her knees. [r]
I could see the blood oozing from her leg. I remembered dedicating a sentence to describing  this arrow in the story.   [r]
It felt incredibly surreal for me to see this arrow that I had created stabbed into the girl  that I wrote this story for, and accompanying that sensation was an overwhelming feeling of  guilt. [r]
The glider that had shot at Miyabe-san turned and prepared to charge at us again. This time  it was aiming specifically for me. [r][hr repage=true]
I turned around to look at this glider as it barreled towards me, and I was all at once hit  with a realization. [r]
This scene, this moment, it was almost identical to a plot beat that I had written in the original Strange Dawn story.

In the Strange Dawn story, the protagonist was saved by a certain tiny human character. [r]
As if to mirror that, the tiny human who was about to shoot me was, without warning, hit  with an arrow that sent him flying off his glider. [r]
I didn't have to guess who saved me. I already knew who it was. It was Shall. [r]
Like a knight in shining armor, Shall flew in on a glider and defiantly fought off the  squadron of Baljidan troops. The troops were outmatched by Shall and had no choice but to retreat. [r]
Having scared off the troops, Shall walked towards us and gave us "grand saviors" a warm introduction. [r]
That surprised me. [hr repage=true]In the original story, there was only one grand savior, but now it appears  as though the story had adjusted itself to have two grand saviors due to me and  Miyabe-san's intrusion into the story. [r]

[delay speed=0]In the lore of the original story, Shall and Princess Arira were the ones who summoned the  protagonist to their world, but I had doubts as to whether they were the ones who truly  brought me and Miyabe-san here. [r]
The light came from within me after all. As I'm writing this entry, my current hunch is that I'm the one who brought Miyabe-san to this world. I don't how I did it, but I somehow manifested my own fictional story into reality. [r]

For the time being, I played along with Miyabe-san's confusion as Shall spoke to us in Japanese. [r]
The fact that Shall did this was something that Miyabe-san pointed out as being strange.   [r]
Truthfully, when I wrote the Strange Dawn story, I'd forgotten to give the characters of this  world their own fantasy language. [r]
It was only until Miyabe-san pointed this out here that I realized my mistake in not acknowledging or explaining what language these characters used in this world.  [r]
I wrote the book in Japanese, so now all of the characters in this world just inexplicably spoke Japanese, while simultaneously not recognizing it as Japanese. [r]
I felt a little embarrassed by my mistake here. [r][hr repage=true]
Anyway, Shall offered to guide us to Belzerg, a village where a lot of the events in my Strange Dawn story took place.  [r]
Nearby, the minor characters of Jorg and Beret called out to Shall.

We arrived at Belzerg. The village was holding a festival.  Again, a very familiar scene like this happened in the original story. [r]
The only difference here was that Miyabe-san seemed incredibly incensed upon seeing the festival. She got even angrier when Reka's Father tried to tell her that we'd be protecting  this village from now on. [r]
I tried to do my best to calm Miyabe-san down. She was understandably overwhelmed by the situation, so it's no wonder she reacted the way she did. [r]
The village had provided the two of us with a lodging. It was a big cave in the village that they had previously used as a warehouse to store things.  [r]
The inside of the cave was just as cozy as I remember writing it. [hr repage=true]What was strange about the  room was that there was a familiar aroma to the area. It reminded me of the smell of my  own room back in the big house I used to live in with my Father.  [r]

I tried to strike up a conversation with Miyabe-san about Belzerg and the tiny humans living  in it. Miyabe-san seemed to have an issue with me calling them humans. [r]
There was a moment in this conversation where it felt like Miyabe-san was suspicious of me.  Although perhaps not. It was difficult to tell what Miyabe-san was thinking. [r]

Miyabe-san said that I'm always so wishy washy when I talk.  [r]
Shall came in at this point to inform the two of us that we were brought to this world to  stop the fighting.  [r]
Reka and Mani were also there. It felt really good to see the two of them. [r]
; Out of all the characters in this story I wrote, it was Reka and Mani who felt the most personal to me.
; REMOVED LINE ABOVE BECAUSE IT GIVES TOO MUCH AWAY TO SHELL YUKO
Shall dropped the bombshell on Miyabe-san that it was impossible for us to go home.  [r]
In the original story, this statement wasn't true, as the protagonist returned home at the end  of the story. Whether it was possible for me and Miyabe-san to return home was another  matter entirely. [r][hr repage=true]
I had no idea how I'd brought us to this world, and so I naturally had no idea how or if I  could even take us back. [r]
Either way, this made Miyabe-san incredibly mad, and she knocked over some tea brought to us by Reka and Mani in her rage. I instinctively helped pick up the tea for Mani and  Reka. [r]

The more I thought about it, the more I realized what a golden opportunity this was. [r]
The entire reason why I wrote this Strange Dawn story in the first place was to give it to Miyabe-san in order to communicate my feelings for her. If she embraced this work, then  that means she'd embrace me and accept how I felt for her. [r]
Ever since the field trip, I felt doubt over whether Miyabe-san was still the person I knew  she was; the chivalrous, kind soul who helped me all those years ago, or if she had been  tainted and ruined by Asami. [r][hr repage=true]
This might be the reason why I brought us here. This world is a test. If Miyabe-san can embrace the role of Grand Savior, if she can grow to care deeply about the characters of this world, if she can embrace who I am, then she was still the same old Miyabe Yuko I knew. [r]
But in addition to all this, there was a part of me that felt terribly guilty. Miyabe-san was hurt as a direct result of my creation. The arrow that pierced her leg was fired by a character I created. [r]

Rather than insisting we go out and fight, Shall read the room and decided to stash the two  of us away in another cave in order to protect us from the Baljidan forces raiding the  village. Dall, one of the villagers, objected heavily to this plan, but Shall ignored him. [r]
Miyabe-san and I were crouched in the dark cave together. I'd always had a fear of being in the dark. [r]
As we sat alone in the cave together, I tried to strike up a conversation with Miyabe-san, but  she didn't respond. This brought back to my mind all the guilt I felt. Why did I do this to her? [r]
That's a stupid question, I knew why I did it. The real question bubbling up inside me was that same old question: "why am I like this?" [r]
Almost unconsciously, the word "sorry" came out of my mouth. [hr repage=true]Miyabe-san heard me say  this. I didn't tell her the real reason I was apologizing, but the justification I gave was close  enough to the truth without revealing what I was keeping hidden from her. [r]

The two of us were interrupted when we heard two people enter the cave. It was Reka and  Mani with our bags. Just as they were about to ask us something, another sound came from  the entrance.  [r]
This time, it was two Baljidan soldiers entering the cave. [r]

Even though this is a world I created, the two of us could be killed here. That was a fact that was made all the clearer to me as the two soldiers inched into the cave. [r]
Even though they were tiny, their swords could probably kill us if they got a good hit in. Thinking about all this made me panic, and I began to breathe heavily. Miyabe-san's phone went off, which alerted the soldiers even more to our whereabouts. [r]
I knew that I had to do something. At that moment, Reka ran towards the soldiers to yell at  them to stay away. I was scared. Mani ran after Reka to stop her. [r]
As one of the soldiers made the order to capture Reka and Mani in order to make them into  hostages, something strange came over me and I started yelling. [hr repage=true]It was a bizarre yell, one  that I wasn't even aware that I was capable of making. [r]
I ran out of the darkness and began charging towards the soldiers. This terrified them and they started to run away in fear. [r]

By the time it was over, me and Miyabe-san were left panting. The entire experience felt like a blur, but it was also characterized by this unique feeling of... fun? [r]
It felt incredibly fun to yell out like that, to singlehandedly push out an entire army, and to run and scream with Miyabe-san. It felt we could do anything together.  [r]
That realization brought a big smile to my face, and I couldn't stop myself from giggling.  That giggling then devolved into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Once I started laughing, I couldn't stop.  [r]
Even as the whole village (Miyabe-san included) looked on at me in confusion, I continued to laugh and laugh. It felt right doing it in the moment, but now I feel incredibly embarrassed  writing about the whole thing.   [r]
That was the end of our first day in this world. [hr repage=true]As I write this, it's the second day of us  being here. Despite how joyful I was at the end of this first day, the aftermath of the  attack on the village was a lot more severe than I expected it to be. [r]

The next day, me and Miyabe-san came across the villagers carrying a big urn. According to Reka and Mani, this urn was used for their funerals. I had forgotten that I had written this  detail into the story when I wrote extensively about Belzerg. [r]
After writing the Strange Dawn story, I only read through it once. I don't remember all of the minor details I wrote into the story with perfect clarity. There were some blind spots in  my memory like this funeral urn.  [r]
Anyway, Mani informed the two of us that a villager died during the raid last night. That never happened in my original writing of the story. The protagonist in the story I wrote didn't let a single villager casualty happen at Belzerg.  [r]
The villager that died was a Father of two children.[hr repage=true] Later on, I watched the funeral of this villager. The two children were crying. [r]
I know these characters aren't real, but I still couldn't help but feel mournful for them. It's  likely that I brought these children characters into existence through a single sentence that I  wrote about Belzerg in my notebook.

Back in our lodgings, I asked as many questions as I could about Belzerg to Reka and Mani. I did this more for Miyabe-san's sake than mine. There was nothing new in what she told me,  no blind spots like with the funeral urn. [r]
It was important now more than ever to get Miyabe-san invested in this world, so she could embrace the Grand Savior role as soon as possible. [r]
I told Miyabe-san that there was maybe something we could do about this situation. [r]
Miyabe-san was not happy with that suggestion. She told me that she hated meddling with other people's business. This shocked me, but her next words hit me even harder. She said, "whatever happens to these guys is none of my business."

[delay speed=0]This statement confused me. When I chased out the Baljidan troops, she joined in with me. And all of that stuff about not wanting to meddle in other people's business was a lie; I knew that for a fact. [r]
Why was she going against her own nature? I didn't even need to ask that question, it was Asami's influence that was making her like this. She went on that field trip and changed. [r][r]
No, I shouldn't blame her. It was a mistake to push her into being a Grand Savior. Because I did that, she felt the need to hide who she truly was. I need to be careful with how I handle things from here on out. [r]
Things aren't like how they were back in junior high. Miyabe-san used to push everyone away  except me. After the field trip, that was no longer the way things were. [r]

After this, Reka exploded at Miyabe-san in anger over what she said. Mani tried to quell things by taking Reka out of our lodgings. [r]
Reka and Mani had brought food to us when they initially came to our lodgings. I started to  dig into my food, until I noticed that Miyabe-san wasn't eating anything. [r]
She seemed upset as well. I tried to ask her why she wasn't eating. She didn't respond. It felt like she was angry at me. I tried to ask her if I had said something to upset her. [r]
All Miyabe-san said to me was, "We just have different ways of thinking. You think your way, and I think my way. That's fine by itself." [r]
Hearing her say this made me feel an almost indescribable sense of sadness, because I knew  she was right.[hr repage=true] I'm a cowardly idiot.

What am I doing? [r]
After Miyabe-san left our lodgings, I pulled out a blank notebook that I had buried in my school bag, and I just started writing in it, in an attempt to make the guilty feeling in my chest go away. [r]
But despite everything I've written in this journal, the guilty feeling weighing on my chest still  hasn't abated. [r]
No... I can't give up. [r]
I wrote about this earlier on, about how this third term was my last chance to get close to Miyabe-san. If I give up now, then the only person who ever showed me kindness will slip through my fingers.

So, it appears this place we're in is some kind of fictional world created by this Natsuno Eri girl. [np]
I'm also starting to realize that perhaps my name  isn't actually Shall. [np]
From what's written in this journal, it seems like  Shall is a character created by Natsuno Eri. [np]
The journal says that this fictional world is "made up of tiny humans." [l]That would explain  why this village is so small. [np]
If Shall is a character of this world, then that would mean that he's a tiny human. [np]
From the way I towered over the huts in this village, it seems almost guaranteed at this point  that my name is not Shall. [np]

This leads me to believe that I'm either the person called Natsuno Eri, or the person called  Miyabe Yuko. [np]
;Whichever person I'm not is probably who the girl I saw lying down is. [np]

Either way, there's still several unsolved questions I have left. [np]

Also, it doesn't seem like Natsuno Eri or Miyabe  Yuko had the same sketchy scenery when they  were transported to this world. [np]
If they did, you'd think that Eri would mention it at some point in her journal. [np]

As my foot hits the forest ground, I suddenly find myself in a  completely different place. [np]

I'm on some kind of rocky incline. [nl]Was I just transported here from the forest? [np]

It all happened so fast as I was in the middle of walking that  when I put my other foot down, [np]

A lot of strange things have happened to me since my last journal entry. [r]
As I write this, we're on our fifth day of being in this world.  [r]
At the moment, Miyabe-san and I are not on good terms. There's a reason for this, but it won't make sense without the necessary context which I will now elaborate on. [r]
I suppose I should start by talking about the extremely close call I had with Miyabe-san back  on day 2. After I finished writing up the previous journal entry, I left my journal in our  lodgings and went in search of a restroom. [r]
I didn't write any restroom related scenes in the original Strange Dawn story, so they simply  didn't exist in this world. That was an oversight that I couldn't possibly have expected to  affect me down the line. [r][hr repage=true]
I walked around the village aimlessly.  [r]
At one point, I did have an encounter with the child character who's Father died. He told  me that [r]
Actually, nevermind. Let's just move on to what happened when I returned to our lodgings. [r]

The first thing I saw when I returned to our lodgings was Miyabe-san. She was sat at the other end of the room and she had my journal splayed open in her hands. She was reading from it. [r]
In that moment, I thought everything was over. The cat was out of the bag. That journal outlined everything. If she was reading from it, there was no possible excuse I could come up with to justify its contents. [r]
As I timidly walked up to Miyabe-san, my mind desperately raced to find some way that I could spin this.  [r]
But before I could even speak, Miyabe-san said, "What happens in the end? Does the heroine in this story go back home in the end?" [r]
This took me by surprise, but that was until I got closer to Miyabe-san and was able to peak at what page of the journal she was reading.

I had somehow dodged a bullet, but I wasn't in the clear yet. [r]

I tried to keep my cool. The only thing that I could come up with to say to Miyabe-san was, "it's just a story." That was the best I could do in the heat of the moment. [r]
Fortunately, Miyabe-san did not read on any further. She closed my journal and handed it back to me, and I internally breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life.  [r]
Almost immediately, I tried to deflect the conversation as far away from the journal as I  could. I asked Miyabe-san if something was wrong. She said there wasn't, but she seemed quite down. [r]
There was a part of me that wondered if perhaps Miyabe-san did read more of the journal  and was just hiding it, but Miyabe-san didn't strike me as the kind of person who'd act like  that. If she did know the truth, she'd immediately confront me about it. [r][hr repage=true]
Miyabe-san isn't a coward like me. If something annoys or angers her, she doesn't hesitate to  speak loudly and openly about it. [r]

I decided to take the risk anyway, and asked Miyabe-san if she didn't like the food. She  told me that she was afraid to eat. She added that if she ate something foreign from this world, something weird may happen, and that's why she was refusing to eat. [r]
I wished she'd just embrace this world and start eating the food here. Did she really hate  this world so much that she'd rather starve than eat anything in it?  [r]
I did my best to tell her that she shouldn't starve herself like this, but she shut me down by  telling me that she wasn't planning on not eating anything forever. I had no retort to that. [r]
Miyabe-san decided that we should return to the stone ring monument where we first arrived in this world to look for clues. [hr repage=true]For the time being, I decided to go along with Miyabe-san's plan. [r]

I decided to take the risk anyway, and asked Miyabe-san if she didn't like the food. She  told me that she was afraid to eat. She added that if she ate something foreign from this world, something weird may happen, and that's why she was refusing to eat. [r]
I wished she'd just embrace this world and start eating the food here. Did she really hate  this world so much that she'd rather starve than eat anything in it?  [r]
I did my best to tell her that she shouldn't starve herself like this, but she shut me down by  telling me that she wasn't planning on not eating anything forever. I had no retort to that. [r]
Miyabe-san decided that we should return to the stone ring monument where we first arrived in this world to look for clues. [hr repage=true]For the time being, I decided to go along with Miyabe-san's plan. [r]
I already knew that there would be no clues at the stone ring monument, but there was no way for me to tell Miyabe-san that without revealing to her that I knew more about this world than I should. [r]

[delay speed=0]Miyabe-san walked up to Jorg and informed him of her plan. In the original Strange Dawn story, this Jorg character was a one-off background character I wrote for a scene and then  ditched for the rest of the story. [r]
Somehow, this character had become more important, likely due to the influence of Miyabe-san and me. [r]
This all got me to wonder what would happen if the story strayed further and further away from the original plot beats of the story I had written. [hr repage=true]This world seemed to automatically  adapt and change in order to compensate for all the different actions we were taking within  the story. [r]

If things strayed further and further away from the original story I'd written, then it's possible that I'd have no way of knowing what would happen in the future.  [r]
There would be no familiar rehashing of plot beats from my story. Everything would be new  and unexpected to me, which was dangerous because that meant that I couldn't foresee and  work around those beats in order to protect Miyabe-san. [r]
Anyway, let's leave that there for now. Upon listening to Miyabe-san's orders, all five of us set off towards the stone ring monument where Miyabe-san and I first arrived at. [r]
As we walked, I tried to strike up a conversation with Miyabe-san. I brought up the girls in  our social studies group who we last saw crying, but Miyabe-san didn't seem interested in  that conversation topic. [r][hr repage=true]
I decided to move the conversation on to Reka and how she was clearly in love with Shall.  [r]
I remember when I first came up with the idea of Reka during that long sleepless night I had  writing the Strange Dawn story. [r]

One side of me feels like it's perpetually exploding with emotion.  [r]
When something upsets me,  this side of me wants to burst into tears. When something angers  me, this side of me wants to throttle whatever spurned me. When something wonderful  happens, this side of me wants to indulge in that wonder forever. [r]
No matter what situation I'm in, it feels like this side of me is constantly screaming at me to  do something. [r]
Sometimes, the orders it screams at me to do are deranged. Other times, the orders have been perfectly natural responses to the situations I've found myself in. [r][hr repage=true]
This side of me often becomes filled with doubt and that doubt gets turned onto me. That's  when negative thoughts start to cloud my mind, thoughts about why I refuse to act on this  side of me, especially in the moments where it would benefit me to do so. [r]
Am I making any sense here? I know in psychology there's all kinds of terms and systems they  use to explain all this.

[delay speed=0]I tried reading books about this during my time in junior high, but every new book had a different complex, interlocking system filled with intricate terms that you had to wrap your head around. [r]
All of these systems and terms just felt like personal fictions to me. Rather than a map of reality, it was a fiction mapped onto reality. The way the systems would connect felt similar to how the plot points in a story would connect.  [r][hr repage=true]
Through this view, you could say that all the terms these writers come up with are the characters. [r]

In that sense, that's what Reka is. Whatever you call it: the inner self, the id, the "I"; they're all just characters. [r]
The other side of me is perpetually reigning in this "Reka" side. The only way it can do this is by blocking it from coming out as much as possible. [r]
The other side does everything it can to stop the pessimism, emotions, and worries proliferated by the "Reka" side from bubbling to the surface. [r]
I say all this now as if I consciously made the decision to create a character based around all  this, but that's not how it happened in the moment.  [r][hr repage=true]
During the night when I created Strange Dawn, I just wrote on instinct. There wasn't a  moment where I stopped to consider what I was writing; the work just poured out of me. [r]
It's only now that I'm looking back on this retrospectively, that I'm coming up with this fictional map to pin down the amorphous experience I had in order to make it graspable. [r]
Either way, that's the story I'm sticking to, so that's how Reka came about. [r]

All the other characters in the story are personal to me in some way of course. But some  characters are more personal than others. [r]
So I brought up Reka to Miyabe-san in an attempt to get her opinion on the girl's relationship to Shall. [r]
Miyabe-san seemed dismissive of the girl's affection for Shall. She said that if Reka was that  worried about him, then she should have come with us. [r]
 I felt a little sad when Miyabe-san said this. It felt unfair to Reka. Miyabe-san told me that she didn't mean to force me to come with her. I said to Miyabe-san, "you don't seem  to like the people here." [r][hr repage=true]
In response to this, Miyabe-san just dismissed what I said. She then stopped walking out of the blue and complained about how there was a rock in her shoe. [r]
And [r]
Oh. I just remembered what happened here.

By the end of Day 3, it felt like things we're starting to look up for me. The situation wasn't  ideal; Miyabe-san was now dead set on finding Pricness Arira so she could get her to send  the two of us back home as soon as possible. [r]
In truth, it was unlikely that Princess Arira would even be capable of returning us home. After all, I was the one who brought us here, so it seemed likely that I was the only one who  could bring us back. [r]
However, not only did I have no idea how to even do this, there was also a part of me that wasn't ready to go back home yet. [r]
Miyabe-san had yet to fully embrace this world. The fact that she was so adamant on going  home was proof of that. [r][hr repage=true]
But it was starting to feel like the cracks were beginning to show. This new person that Miyabe-san became following the school trip felt like a facade to me. The person who she truly was, the person I remembered her being back in junior high, was definitely under this  facade. [r]

But by the end of day 3, she was happily tucking into the food that Beret gave her. That  was a far cry to how she used to be. [r]

Shall informed us that Princess Arira had been captured by the Baljidan forces. In order to rescue her, we'd have to get directly involved with the conflict of this story and save her.  [r]
This was how the protagonist of the story I wrote became wrapped up in this world. She wanted to go back home and the only way she could do this was through Princess Arira.  [r]
It was only by going through all of the various conflicts and plot beats that I had laid out  for her, that the protagonist of my story came to mature and embrace her role as Grand  Savior.  [r][hr repage=true]
I could see the same thing happening with Miyabe-san. All I had to do was make sure that the proverbial carrot on the stick of Princess Arira was always kept ahead of her, as I guided Miyabe-san through the various conflicts of my story. That way, I could bring back the old chivalrous Miyabe Yuko, the person who she truly was before she went on that field trip and  changed. [r]

[delay speed=0]In that sense, it was like I was putting a real life person through the hero's journey. The moment when Miyabe-san reached the end of the journey would be the moment where I'd confess my love to her.  [r]
In order to bring that moment to fruition, I'd be willing to keep this story going with Miyabe-san in it for as long as it took. [r][hr repage=true]
The best part of this plan was that none of the characters I created would have to suffer or  die, as long as Miyabe-san embraced her role as grand savior. That's how it went in the original story, and I had a hunch that this was how it would be in this story, so long as we didn't divert too much from the original outline. [r]

But even while I thought all this, there was a part of me deep down that had doubts over whether the characters I created would really be spared from suffering as long as Miyabe-san embraced her role as grand savior. Those doubts bubbled up inside me, but I refused to acknowledge them. [r]
Even as the feeling of doubt became more and more pronounced, I continued to ignore it  and bury it deeper and deeper until the voice went silent and didn't speak again.   [r]
Once I did that, I felt quite happy. It felt good to be standing in this world I'd created. The breeze felt liberating. [r]
The next day, I was walking alongside Miyabe-san. My high spirits from the previous day had  not yet dissipated. [r][hr repage=true]
Quite a few interesting things of note happened here. [r]
Miyabe-san remembered when I mentioned my time spent at a foreign school, and we briefly had a discussion about my time there. Miyabe-san also ate a worm that Beret gave her.

[delay speed=0]This was another one of those minor details I had written into the story on a whim that was now backfiring on me. I had made a worm a confection that the characters would eat. [r]
The last thing I wanted to do was eat a worm, and it didn't matter to me that I made them taste like butter. It was still insanely shocking to witness Miyabe-san just consume the worm  without batting an eye. [r]
If this was a sign of how close Miyabe-san was to embracing this world, then I couldn't help but feel encouraged that my plan was going better than I expected. [r]

That was until something rather significant and unexpected happened to me. [r]
After walking for a couple of hours, we had arrived at a river and decided to take a rest stop there.  [r]
Me and Miyabe-san had split off from the others to wash our clothes. While I was idly washing my clothes, I asked Miyabe-san if she disliked Shall. [r]
To me, it felt she didn't like her character. [r]
Miyabe-san confirmed this assumption, stating that she didn't like how emotional he was. [r]
Emotional? That wasn't how I perceived Shall or the true Miyabe-san to be at all.  [r]
I told Miyabe-san that I thought we should all try to be friends, especially since we were travelling together. [r][hr repage=true]
Miyabe-san objected to this, saying that it was okay to hate someone who didn't make the effort to become friends. [r]

Miyabe-san got up and turned her back to me. She said, "if everyone tried to get along,  we'd just be lying to each other", and walked off. [r]
I didn't know what she was talking about. There was nothing deceptive about trying to get  along with everyone. [r]
The old Miyabe-san never had this philosophy. She actively went out of her way to help everyone. How could she now call that deceptive? [r]
It became clear to me now why Miyabe-san hated Shall so much. [r]
Shall was another personal character to me. [r][hr repage=true]
In a sense, you could say that Shall was my portrait of Miyabe-san. All of the observations that I had made of Miyabe-san from afar through junior high and high school were written  into Shall. [r]

I knew why Miyabe-san hated Shall. She hated him because he embodied everything she used to be; the person she was before the field trip. [r]
I don't know what Asami said to Miyabe-san to make her think like this, but she now viewed her past self as a mistake. [r]
How awful. How terrible. [r]
When Miyabe-san left, I buried my head in my knees. I felt like I was about to cry. [r]
Suddenly, a heavy wind blew. Miyabe-san and I had hung our other set of clothes on a tree  to dry. [r]
Fearing that the clothes would be blown away, I jumped up in an attempt to block the  wind. That was when I noticed a light emanating from the forest. [r][hr repage=true]
It reminded me of a camera flash. One of the items Miyabe-san had in her school bag was a camera, so at first I thought it might be her.
 But as I looked closer, I noticed that there was a figure in the light.

None of this felt familiar to me. I didn't remember writing any of this in the original Strange Dawn story. [r]
This fact is what spurned me on towards the light. As I moved towards the figure in the light, it started to move away from me. [r]
As I followed the figure, I continuously called out to it, but it didn't respond. [r]
Eventually, it brought me to the entrance of a cave. I recognized the cave. The protagonist of my story took shelter in this cave to avoid a swarm of birds that came rushing at her  from a floating bird hive that passed by. [r]
The figure went into the cave. I couldn't stop here. I had to know what this figure was. I didn't remember creating anything like it in my story, so how could it exist here? [r][hr repage=true]
I followed the figure to the end of the cave. I recognized this place too. It was an area of the cave with an open spire above it. It was here where the protagonist had her first encounter with Princess Arira. [r]

The character had a white mask for a face, large grey hair that was styled like an explosion, and perched upon its head was a top hat. [r]
The figure spoke to me. It said: "don't interfere. The flame of war will definitely burn.  Fighting has been predestined. War will break out and the cycle of life continues. If you stop  the fighting, then you have no place to be in this world. Disappear, Grand Savior." [r]
Upon hearing those words, I wondered if this figure was perhaps a character I had a unintentionally created while I was writing descriptions of the Strange Dawn world. Similar  to how I had forgotten about the minor funeral urn detail. It was also possible that I had  vaguely alluded to some entity, and promptly ended up dropping it as a plot point and forgetting about it. [r][hr repage=true]
It was for this reason that I decided the best course of action was to play along and act like  how the original protagonist of the Strange Dawn story would act in this situation.  [r]

[delay speed=0]The figure told me I couldn't fight, so I put on a heroic front and said that fighting was  never the solution and how it wasn't cool at all. [r]
It felt a bit embarrassing to talk like this. I continued on anyway and boldly declared that there was always a better solution. [r]
When I said this, the figure questioned if I could make it happen. Then, the figure closed in  on me. It was right in front of my face, as it said, "Grand Savior, you're..." [r]

That's what happened in the cave, and even now I find it difficult to wrap my head around  the encounter. [r]
In any case, with the figure gone, there was no longer any need for me to stay in this cave. I  turned around and started to make my way out of the cave. [r]
It was pitch black. I could feel my heart pounding in fear. I just wanted to get out of the  cave and get back to Miyabe-san. [r]
I stumbled through the cave trying to find the exit, but it was incredibly difficult to navigate this place in the dark. The longer I was in the dark, the more panicked I became.  [r]
At some point, I began calling out Miyabe-san's name. The last thing I expected to hear was the voice of Miyabe-san calling out my name in response, and yet that's what happened. [r][hr repage=true]
What followed was a series of back-and-forth calls and responses, as I tried to move towards where the sound of Miyabe-san's voice was coming from. [r]

It was incredibly frustrating to navigate this place. Just as I was about to lose my temper, I  was unexpectedly almost blinded by a bright flash. [r]
Before me was Miyabe-san holding her camera. She had used the camera flash as a makeshift light to navigate the cave. [r]
Miyabe-san was incredibly mad at me. She turned away from me in anger and asked me why  I went off on my own. [r]
As I hesitated and debated in my head whether it would be okay to tell Miyabe-san about  the figure, I suddenly noticed that she was shaking. [r]
Miyabe-san wiped her eyes and, in a quivering voice, said, "you're really an idiot." [r]
I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Miyabe-san was crying. [r][hr repage=true]
I was too stunned to explain to Miyabe-san why I entered this cave, I could only muster a mumbled, "yeah..." in response to Miyabe-san's tearful insult. [r]

After composing herself, Miyabe-san offered me her hand to grab onto. I took hold of it without hesitating, and the two of us sprinted out of the cave. [r]
By the time the two of us were outside the cave, we were exhausted. It was only then that I  realized that Shall had been with us the entire time. I was too preoccupied with Miyabe-san  to even notice him.  [r]
Just as me and Miyabe-san were about to catch our breath, Shall suddenly called out to a  tiny figure in armor that was standing atop an outcrop of rock above the cave.  [r]
Before I could say anything, the armored figure jumped down from the rock and landed before us. [r]
It pulled out a sword and charged at Shall to attack him. [r][hr repage=true]
Just from seeing the armor that the character was wearing, I could tell who it was. [r]
It was Shall's brother, Shura. [r]

The next day, I woke from a nap I had taken under a tree in a field of flowers near the cave where we had spent the night. [r]
I got into a conversation with Mani. She asked me about the world I came from. I kept things vague with how I described my world (I just called it normal). [r]
Up above, there was a dragon messenger flying over us. The people of this world used these dragon messengers to deliver their messages. I was inspired by a similar fantastical postage  system that was used in The Count of Sisley. [r]
Of course, I feigned ignorance of these messengers in order to keep up appearances in front  of Mani. [r][hr repage=true]
As the two of us walked back to the cave, I couldn't help but move the topic of conversation  towards Reka and Shall, specifically about how Reka had an unrequited love for Shall. [r]
I wrote Mani's character, so I also knew that she had her own unrequited love for Shall. That's only natural.

Very few people interacted with this interior "Reka" side of me. It was only in the rare moments when I got the courage to speak up to other people that the "Reka" side came out. This almost never happened, largely thanks to the "Mani" side of me keeping this "Reka" side in check. Miyabe-san was the only person who ever brought this side of me out. [r]

I suppose it's about time I get into the falling out Miyabe-san and I had near the end of day five. [r]
We were right outside the Baljidan border. Everyone decided to take a collective rest here  after all the time we spent walking. [r]
The captain of the Griania troops that had been trailing us this entire time grumbled about how dangerous it was to rest right outside the border, but there wasn't much he could do  to stop us. He needed us more than we needed him. [r]
Me and Miyabe-san were sitting together. I was talking to her, but Miyabe-san seemed disconnected from the conversation; she was completely silent and looking off into the distance. [r][hr repage=true]
It felt uncomfortable to sit in the silence, so I just kept rambling and jumping from topic to  topic almost mindlessly, so I didn't have to sit in it. [r]

[delay speed=0]I wasn't really thinking as I was talking. So, when Miyabe-san out of the blue said, "Huh? What did you just say?" I was initially confused. That was until Miyabe-san brought up the encounter I had with the figure in the cave. [r] [r]
It seemed as though I'd accidentally had a slip of the tongue and mentioned the encounter I  had with the figure in the cave during my ramblings. [r]
Miyabe-san was livid that I had not told her about this right after it happened. [r]

I tried to downplay the encounter, but Miyabe-san snapped at me and said, "Don't keep everything to yourself!" [r]
It felt ridiculous that she was getting angry at me for keeping this encounter a secret, when  she was the same person who constantly went on and on about how much she hated this world and the fantastical things in it. [r]
If I told her about this encounter, she would've been just as angry with me. That's how  she's been ever since we came to this world.  [r]
When I retorted with this, Miyabe-san got even madder at me for deciding all of this on my  own. [r]
Then, Miyabe-san directed a rather pointed question at me. She said, "You seem to care a lot about these little guys and their world. Can't you just think for a second?" [r][hr repage=true]

All she's done is whine about wanting to go home. The characters of this world are suffering, but she doesn't care about anyone except herself. [r]

I've put so much work and love into this creation, and time and time again, Miyabe-san has  refused to see any of that love. [r]
That's the real issue here. This new Miyabe-san lacks any of the love that the old her had. [r]
If Miyabe-san had love, she'd understand this story I made for her and love me in return. [r]
But Asami stripped her of all that.   [r]
With all these thoughts swirling around my head, I couldn't stop myself from exploding at Miyabe-san. [r]
I ranted and raved at her for not wanting the best for the people of this world, how she  was more concerned with going home instead of this world she was in right now, and so on  and so forth. [r][hr repage=true]
By the time I finished my rant, there was no real catharsis to any of it. Before we entered  this world, I would bottle up these kinds of rants and save them for when I was in my room  alone. This was one of the first times that I'd ever blustered at someone so openly. [r]

However, Miyabe-san's shock soon turned to anger. [r]
Wordlessly, she stomped off past me in the direction of the Baljidan border. [r]
When I saw that angry expression on Miyabe-san's face, I immediately started to regret my outburst. [r]
I shouldn't have blown up at her like that. She was slowly starting to accept this world, and now I've pushed her even further away from ever doing that. [r]
Almost unconsciously, my legs started moving to go after Miyabe-san. [r]
I had no idea what I was even planning to do once I caught up with her. [r]
The captain of the Griania forces was running alongside me, trying to warn me about how we were moving towards Baljidan territory. [r][hr repage=true]
I didn't listen to him. I just apologized and said that I couldn't talk right now.

Not much happened after that. Me and Miyabe-san haven't talked since our fight.[r]
It's currently night time at the end of day 5 as I'm writing this entry.   [r]
Whenever there's any down time, I pick up my journal and write an entry into it. [r]
Writing all my thoughts down into this journal feels very therapeutic to me. I was always more of a reader than a writer, but that changed after I wrote Strange Dawn. [r]
Even so, in these moments of downtime, I can't help but wish that I'd brought my Count of  Sisley book with me. [r]
That book has always given me great comfort. I've read it so many times that I can practically recall the book word-for-word from memory. I could probably write out the entire book into this journal if I wished. [r][hr repage=true]
The book opens like this: "The count of Sisley knelt before me. He swore his eternal devotion. He was my first admirer. I guess I need to talk about the princess when I talk about the Count... In the temple,

At this point, I feel pretty sure  of the fact that I'm actually  Miyabe Yuko. [np]
Eri mentions in this journal how  the tiny human characters Shall  and Reka are based off of me and her respectively. [np]

My jumbled memory in this place  led me to believe that my name  was Shall and that the girl lying  on the floor was Reka. [nl][glyph page=framecounter left=80 top=90 fix=true]

I have no idea what I'm  supposed to make of that  encounter Eri had with the  figure. [nl][glyph page=framecounterpage left=80 top=85 fix=true]
I haven't come across a figure  like that yet. [np][glyph page=framecounterpage left=100 top=105 fix=true]

Just as it seemed like I'd gotten everything I wanted, it all fell apart before my eyes, and  now I'm starting to doubt the one thing I felt sure of.[r]
Miyabe Yuko; have I ever truly known this person deep down? Or did I just delude myself  into thinking I knew who she was because I was a pathetic idiot who jumped at the first  person who showed me any kindness.[r]
If Miyabe-san was the person I always thought she was, why would she have that picture? And why would she caress it so tenderly?[r]
It hurts me just thinking about it. It also hurts me to think about this world. [hr repage=true]I have a much  better idea of how it works now, but with this knowledge came the realization of how  untenable it is to perpetually keep this world going.

This probably goes without saying, but Shura was another character I had written based off Miyabe-san. [r]
While Shall was based off of the more chivalrous parts of Miyabe-san that I had witnessed in  junior high, Shura was more so based off the lone wolf part of her. [r]
Although, something that I only realized at that very moment was how much of an overlap there was between the two characters. [r]
They were both chivalrous, and they both preferred to work alone. [r]
There's an added wrinkle to this that I'm only realizing now as I write this. [r]
Perhaps, there was a part of me even back when as I was writing Strange Dawn that had some doubts over whether Miyabe-san was truly the chivalrous person I thought she was. [r][hr repage=true]
As I recount all this, I'm beginning to think that I may have funneled some of that doubt into the character of Shura, at least subconsciously. [r]
I suppose, to summarize, I'd say that Shura and Shall are to Miyabe-san, how Reka and  Mani are to me. [r]

And that's when I saw it: the bird hive. [r]
There, floating in the sky, was a bird hive. [r]
In the original Strange Dawn story, I'd written a description of it based on how I imagined it  to look in my head. [r]
This bird hive before me matched that description perfectly. [r]
It was incredibly surreal to see such a massive creation of mine manifested in such a tangible  way. I could only stare at in awe. [r]
Shura called out to me. Now was the perfect opportunity to go raid the village and rescue everyone. [r]
Shura said he didn't think the birds would attack me, but I already knew that they probably would. [r][hr repage=true]
They attacked the original protagonist of the Strange Dawn story, so I didn't see why they wouldn't attack me. It wasn't as if they held some sort of affection for me as their creator

Levian pointed a sword down at Miyabe-san. Upon seeing the Levian character, I was hit  with a wave of both fondness and embarrassment. [r]
Levian was the kind of person I'd always wanted to be. She was strong, intelligent, outspoken, and, above all else, chivalrous. [r]
In many ways, she was similar to Miyabe-san, or at least the perception that I had of her. [r]
That's not an accident. In addition to loving Miyabe-san, I also wanted to be Miyabe-san. [r]
In that sense, Levian was an embodiment of my desire to be her. [r]
As Levian pointed her sword at Miyabe-san, another character I recognized entered the scene. It was Deum. [r][hr repage=true]
Deum was another character similar to Dall. After the Harada incident, I felt like I had betrayed Miyabe-san. [r]

As Levian told us that her underlings were fighting for the same reason, I had a massive realization. [r]
Back on day four, I had that encounter with the mysterious figure in the cave. [r]
Initially, I believed that the figure must've been a character I had unintentionally created  during the writing process of the Strange Dawn story. [r]
However, Levian's words here made me think back on that encounter, and I came to a different realization about the figure. [r]
At the end of day three, there was a moment of doubt I had over whether the characters I'd created would really not suffer, as long as Miyabe-san and I embraced our roles as Grand Saviors. [r][hr repage=true]
There was a voice of doubt in my head at the time, which I pushed down to avoid thinking about the suggestion it was making.

[delay speed=0]It was only after Levian said this that I thought back on the words of that figure, and suddenly realized that the voice of doubt inside me at the end of day 3 was expressing very  similar sentiments to what the strange figure was saying about how the fighting, the conflict  of the story, was predestined.

In my first year of high school, I read a book on storytelling. I had no interest in writing at  the time, but the author of one of my favorite books of all time, The Count of Sisley, had  cited this book on storytelling as being a massive influence on his work. [r]
The count of Sisley was my biggest inspiration (other than Miyabe-san) for writing Strange Dawn, and I was, in many ways, trying to emulate that book with Strange Dawn. I loved all  the characters in that book, whether it be the stoic Count, the kind princess, or the grumpy  dragon. [r]
The book was my biggest reference point for Strange Dawn, and I tried to replicate it's structure and style closely. [r][hr repage=true]
The tiny humans, the dragon messengers, the warring states, the gliders; almost all of these  elements were ripped from The Count of Sisley. [r]

The book on storytelling that inspired the Count of Sisley was called "Conflict: the Engine of  Storytelling" [r]
The book in question stated that "conflict" was the fundamental driving force of all stories. Although rather than calling it a driving force, it's perhaps more appropriate to call it a  fuel. [r]
Regardless of whether or not this was true of all stories, the fact of the matter is that when  I was writing my Strange Dawn story, I used the Count of Sisley book as my reference  model, and so I structured the story I was writing around a series of conflicts. [r]
So by all accounts, Strange Dawn was a story that was fueled by conflict, and as long as the story had to continue, conflict would arise in order to keep the story going. [r][hr repage=true]
That was the realization I came to upon hearing Levian's words.  [r]

[delay speed=0]The only way to stop this conflict was for the story to end. Once the story was over and the final plot point of the story was reached, the conflict of this world would cease, and the characters contained within it could live on peacefully. [r]
But for that to happen, the protagonists of the story, me and Miyabe-san, would have to  push the plot in that direction. If we don't do that, the story will just loop through an  endless series of conflicts (both external and internal), so that it can keep going on perpetually. [r]

But as I came to this realization, another thought popped into my head: do I want things to end yet? [r]
Miyabe-san had not yet embraced this world. She was still fighting against it at every turn.  [r]
If I allowed this story to end, then all of this would've been a waste of time. The suffering this world has endured would've all been for nothing. [r]
I couldn't allow this story to end until Miyabe-san embraced it. But how long would that  take? [r]
It hurt me to see these characters I'd made suffer. Another detail that the "Conflict: the Engine of Storytelling" book stated was that every subsequent conflict would have to escalate  in order to keep the story interesting.[hr repage=true] Would this mean that the conflicts, and therefore the  suffering, of this world would get worse the more it continued on? [r]
All of these thoughts swirled in my mind, and just as I was about to shout out to Levian to tell her to stop, Miyabe-san suddenly spoke up and said something I'd never expected her to say.

She didn't want them to fight? I couldn't believe it. Miyabe-san just admitted she cared about this world, about the characters living in it. I had won. [r]

As Miyabe-san and I were hanging perilously over the edge of the cliff, the adrenaline and  fear of the situation must've messed with my head. [r]
In that moment, I couldn't help it and blurted out the first thing that came to my mind,  which was the realization that I was currently going through my... "time of the month", so  to say. [r]
Miyabe-san looked at me in astonishment for bringing this up as we were hanging over the edge of a cliff. [r]
Reflexively, I apologized for saying something so strange. [r]
Miyabe-san, somewhat uncharacteristically, smiled at me and told me that she had something  that could help me. She also added, "We'll make it through somehow. We'll go home." [r]

[delay speed=0]For once, I actually agreed with Miyabe-san's desire for us to return home. Miyabe-san had embraced this world. That, combined with the moment where Miyabe-san cried for me  when I left her alone to follow that ghostly figure into the cave, was all the proof I needed  to know that Miyabe-san was capable of loving me. [r]
In retrospect, this moment of us hanging over the edge of a cliff was probably the height of our relationship; the closest that I felt to Miyabe-san, and the happiest I felt at the prospects  of our relationship. [r]
Unbeknownst to me, it would all be downhill from here. [r]

As the two of us crawled up from the edge of the cliff, Miyabe-san said something that  took me completely by surprise. [r]
"No, I saw the ghost that you saw." At first, I was completely taken aback by this. Miyabe-san told me that this apparently happened when she went back into the Baljidan  village to get my bag. [r]
I know now as of writing this journal entry that the apparition Miyabe-san saw was probably not the same one I saw. There's another apparition in this world. This one seems to have been  manifested from my other desire to not see this world suffer. [r]
The moment that it was manifested was right after I had my realization about how this story world ran on conflict and how all the characters would need to suffer in order for this  world to continue on perpetually.  [r]

[delay speed=0]We haven't reached this moment yet, but just before we separated, Miyabe-san and I had an encounter with both of these apparitions, so I know from this what the other apparition  looks like and what it likely said to Miyabe-san. [r]
Back when Miyabe-san first told me about the apparition, I had no knowledge of this, so I could only assume that Miyabe-san encountered the same apparition that I met in the cave. [r]
Unfortunately, there was barely any time for me to consider the implications of this, as Levian came flying down on a glider in order to warn us that we had to keep running,  because we hadn't lost the Baljidan forces who were on our tails yet. [r]

Shura thanked the two of us. [r]
Miyabe-san deflected the gratitude in a way that was very reminiscent of how she used to do  it in junior high. I added that Shura could come visit the village any time. [r]
As Shura lowered his head, Miyabe-san pulled out her mini pink scrapbook from her bag,  and peeled off a photographic sticker inside. I didn't get a chance to see inside the scrapbook  as I was too focused on Shura. [r]
All I saw was the photographic sticker that Miyabe-san had stuck onto the headpiece of Shura's armor. It was a photo of Miyabe-san and Asami, framed within the border of a  love heart. [r]
Miyabe-san called this sticker a "souvenir". The moment I saw this happen, I couldn't stop  my face from beaming in delight. [r]

[delay speed=0]For me, this moment was the ultimate proof that I had won; the ultimate sign that Miyabe-san had given up on her adoration for Asami. After all, why would she part with  such an important memento of her relationship with Asami? [r]
The reason was obvious. Now that Miyabe-san had me, she no longer viewed Asami with the  same reverence she once did. [r]
And it was all thanks to Strange Dawn. I had effectively used this story as a tool to change Miyabe-san into the person I wanted her to be. [r]

It was at this thought that something strange happened. [r]
As if out of nowhere, I was hit with a massive wave of guilt that gnawed at me so hard, it felt like my heart was about to be torn in two. [r]
I could barely decipher the reason why I was feeling such an overwhelming guilt in that moment. I could only watch on as the figure of Shura slowly disappeared into the distance. [r]
For a time, I remained frozen with an inexplainable expression on my face. [r]
Beret and Jorg were bantering about something, but I was barely listening to anything going  on around me. [r]
Soon enough, our group set off in the direction back towards Belzerg. [r][hr repage=true]
Everyone else moved except me. It took Miyabe-san turning back and calling out to me to get  me out of my daze. [r]
With some trepidation, I followed after them. [r]

On the way back to the village, I pulled out my journal and began sketching a picture of me and Miyabe-san in it.  [r]
The guilt from before was still gnawing away at me. [r]
All I knew at the time was that the guilt definitely had something to do with Miyabe-san giving that sticker of her and Asami away to Shura. [r]
In addition to this, I was starting to feel anxious about returning to the village. [r]
We were on day seven of being in this world. In the original Strange Dawn story, day seven was around the time when the story came to an end. [r]
The fact that we were still no closer to the final plot beat meant that a conflict was almost  inevitably going to be coming our way in order to keep this story going. [r][hr repage=true]
As we moved closer and closer to the village, my hunch that a conflict was inevitably coming our way became greater and greater. [r]

Watching this scene between Reka and Mani got me to realise something. In the past, I had  believed that as me and Miyabe-san changed the story more and more, it would end up becoming so different from the original story that there would be no similar plot beats. [r]
That assumption was evidently mistaken when it came to the characters. [r]
This version of the Strange Dawn story that me and Miyabe-san were weaving together wasn't a one-to-one replica of the original Strange Dawn. Despite this, it appeared as though the characters were naturally gravitating towards the arc and plot beats laid out for them in the original story. [r]
Reka and Shall ending up together seems to be a predestined thing to happen somewhere around the final plot beat. [hr repage=true]Other things, like main character deaths in the original story, are  also likely to be predestined to happen. [r]

[delay speed=0]However, until Miyabe-san and I pushed the story towards that final plot beat, the story would just loop a series of unending conflicts between Reka and Shall in order to keep them  from being together. All of these Reka and Shall conflicts are just repurposed versions of the  conflicts I made the two characters go through in their original story. [r]
Without the outside interference of Miyabe-san or I, the story naturally moves towards the  plot beats outlined in my original story. In other words, this story can be ended as long as I want it to end. But for the longest time, I didn't want it to stop.[hr repage=true] That's why, despite  constantly asserting how much I wanted the fighting to stop, I continued to do nothing, while  Miyabe-san continuously rejected this world. [r]
As I watched the scene playing out before me between Mani and Shall, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Mani. I knew that it was predestined for Shall to end up with Reka. When I  was writing the story, I truly believed that Miyabe-san would never love the "Mani" side of  me. [r]

"You should do what you want to. It's hard to admit you're selfish, but at least you can be honest with yourself." Miyabe-san directed those words to Mani, but she might as well have been saying them to me. [r]
That's right. I am selfish. I trapped Miyabe-san in this world. I've spent this entire time deceiving her. [r]
For what purpose? Because I wanted her all to myself. From the very beginning I've been selfish. [r]
When Miyabe-san said those words, I couldn't help but wonder why I was letting the guilt of these actions get the better of me. [r]
Why don't I just ignore the guilt? Why don't I just keep Miyabe-san trapped in here forever and make this world ours? Why don't I just turn a blind eye to the suffering of all the characters I've made? [r][hr repage=true]
If I could do that, I'd be happy. [r]

Why did I start feeling guilt when Miyabe-san gave away that sticker to Shall? [r]
The answer was obvious to me now. Once it became clear that I'd changed Miyabe-san, I suddenly realized that this entire change was all as a result of me deceiving her. [r]
I had taken Miyabe-san against her will into this world and deceived her into thinking I had nothing to do with it. I had deceived Miyabe-san into thinking I was just as blind as she  was. And ultimately, I had deceived her into caring about me. [r]
This entire relationship we had formed wasn't built on trust, it was built on deception. [r]
And this entire story I had made was nothing but a tool of deception. [r][hr repage=true]
When Mani eventually left our lodgings, I couldn't help but turn to Miyabe-san and ask her,  "Have you ever regretted something you did?" [r]
Miyabe-san was surprised to hear me ask her this. Her answer to the question was, "Of course I have. Plenty of times." [r]
She then asked me, "how about you Natsuno-san?" [r]

Miyabe-san decided that she would be leaving the village in the middle of the night to head back to the promontory. [r]
Of course, I was going to go with her. [r]
At the time, I had a hunch that such an action was unlikely to push the story forward, and that it would only serve to keep the story going. [r]
Despite this, I still went along with Miyabe-san. At this point, I felt completely lost as to  what I should even do. [r]
It felt like I'd never get out of this dilemma. [r]
We left behind a note for the people at Belzerg, and set off under the cover of night. [r]
The promontory was quite far away. [hr repage=true]We were about a quarter of the way there, when  Miyabe-san and I decided we should set up camp at a nearby cave with a massive opening. [r]
The two of us were wearing our gym clothes that we had been alternating with our normal school uniform throughout our time in this world.

At the far end of the cave, I was reading through my journal in order to make sense of everything that had happened to me. I didn't feel like writing in the journal with Miyabe-san  near me. [r]
As I looked up from my journal to look over at Miyabe-san (who was closer to the cave's entrance with her back to me), I noticed that she had her mini scrapbook out. [r]
The first thing I noticed was that she had another photographic sticker of her and Asami together, but that wasn't the sight that tore me up inside. [r]
I silently watched Miyabe-san from behind as she wistfully looked at one photograph in particular. [r]
The photo was of three people: Miyabe-san, Asami, and Harada-sensei. Harada-sensei had  his arms around the two girls. [r]

Miyabe-san's next words broke my heart: "we couldn't help that." [r]
I became more and more desperate as the conversation went on. [r]
I was beginning to think that this person who I'd fell in love with was a complete stranger to me. [r]
Did I ever truly know Miyabe Yuko? Or had I just been seeing whatever I wanted to see in her. [r]
At first, I thought that Asami had changed Miyabe-san, but what if Miyabe-san had just always been like this? [r]
Did I turn a blind eye to all of this because she was one of the first people to go out of their  way for me? [r][hr repage=true]

I could feel tears building up in my eyes. I couldn't find the strength to respond to Miyabe-san. [r]
Suddenly, Miyabe-san stood up, dusted off her skirt, and said, "Hey. I think we should go  our own ways." [r]
Miyabe-san picked up her bag and prepared to leave. Reflexively, I called out, "no!" [r]
I tried to say whatever I could to convince Miyabe-san to stay with me, but she was dismissive with everything I said. [r]

One side of me wanted to keep the story going, while the other side of me wanted to end  this story and return home already. [r]
I took hold of Miyabe's hand and grasped it tightly. [hr repage=true]The instant I did this, everything  around us went black. [r]

The moment that Miyabe-san left, I buried my head in my knees. [r]
For the next couple of hours, I reflected on everything that happened. [r]
With Miyabe-san gone, I was now completely alone. There were no characters I'd created there to comfort me. [r]
Instead, it was just me and my own thoughts that I had to contend with. [r]
Unexpectedly, I began to see everything with a level of clarity that I hadn't experienced before. [r]
The first epiphany I came to was regarding all of the characters I created for this world. [r]
Almost all of them fall into one of four main archetypes: the "Eri" archetype, the "Yuko" archetype, the "Harada-sensei" archetype, and finally the "Asami" archetype. [r]

[delay speed=0]Any minor character that falls outside one of these archetypes is slowly forced to gravitate  towards one of them if the story starts to focus on them. [r]
A prime example of this is Beret. Something strange I noticed as we were making our way back to Belzerg is that Beret was incredibly affectionate and attentive towards Miyabe-san.  Beret didn't fall in love with the protagonist of the original Strange Dawn story, and in fact,  he was originally a minor character who was only supposed to show up for one scene and  never again. [r][hr repage=true]
The original Beret had no characterization. And so, this world has automatically started to gravitate him towards the "Eri" archetype as it has continued on.
 As long as this world continues on, I suspect that this will inevitably happen to all of the other minor characters who've gotten more focus. [r]
The sole exception to this is Reka's Father. In truth, I'd always based this character off of my own Father. So in this case, I guess you can say that there are actually five archetypes, if you include my Father as one of them.

The second epiphany I had on the back of this was connected to the very nature of all the characters in this story. [r]
Every character I've created here is just a fictional shell. They are all, at base, written to be  hollow representations of a concept, an idea, or a perception of someone or something in the  real world. [r]
These fictional shells can only act according to what was written about them and their arc in the original story. And I suspect that if the original story is destroyed in reality, all the fictional shells that inhabit this world will be destroyed along with it. [r]
The only time the shells can divert from what was originally written for them in my story is if  either me or Miyabe-san influence or push them towards not following their intended path. [r][hr repage=true]
Ultimately, the more developed characters still all gravitate towards their intended character  arcs and plot beats, or at least towards a facsimile of them. [r]

[delay speed=0]In that sense, perhaps putting some distance between ourselves and the characters was the  correct decision to make. [r]
The less input we have in a situation, the more the characters will all gravitate towards the original plot beats of the story. [r]

This brings us back to the ultimate question: Do I want this story world to end? [r]
The sun is currently setting on day nine as I'm writing this entry at the promontory where Miyabe-san left me behind. [r]
The entire reason why I decided to pick up this journal and write this entry was to try and collect my thoughts together, so I could come to a decision on what I should do next. [r]
But even after writing all this, I still have no idea what I should do. [hrs]
Maybe, the only path forward is for me to go down with my creation. [r]
The way I see it, I'm just as hollow as all of the fictional shells I've created. [r]
If I can somehow help Miyabe-san return home without me, then maybe that's the best possible end for me.

That place only has two paths; one taking us to this promontory, and  the other one taking us back to the location of the second journal entry. [l]
 There's no other paths to take outside of that. [np]

This promontory may as well be the end of the line. [np]

[delay speed=45].[wc time=15].[wc time=15].[wc time=15][delay speed=user]I've made up my mind. [l]I'm going to run back to the village where  the first journal entry is, so I can check over it again. [np]
I'm pretty sure it mentioned something about the original story's ending. [np]

While I'm there, I'll pay a visit to Eri. [nl]
It's possible she might've woken up from whatever unconscious state she  was in. [np]

Sounds like a plan. [np]

There, dotted out on the  ground like a chalk outline  around a dead body, is a tiny  figure. [np]

Chiefly, I hate all of the parts of myself that make up this work. [r]
I'm sick of it all. The canvas of this world has been sculpted out of my desires, inked with my fears, and framed with my flaws. And the image is just so awful to look at.[r]
All I see when I look at this work now is a portrait of a cowardly human being, and all of that wretchedness has been refracted and reflected off of everything I've created in this  world.[r]
But it's not just in this world where I see this cowardice. It's in this journal as well.[r]
It now pains me to read back through what I've written.[hr repage=true] Why? Because I can see all of the  delusions, all of the naiveties, and all of the self-deceptions that line its' pages.[r]

Miyabe Yuko. Did I ever truly know this person? [r]
I don't think I did. I just latched on to the first person who showed me any kindness. [r]
Everything after that was just a long protracted act of self-deception. [r]
I built up an image of this girl in my head, and when she inevitably betrayed that image, it brought me to hysterics. [r]
The fact of the matter is that I was too swept up in my own jubilance to see the girl for who she was, warts and all. [r]
Yuko is selfish. She had admitted that fact herself. She is a cold person that pushes everyone  away, and yet she still constantly seeks out the affection of others. [r]
All of this was evident from the moment I first met her.[hr repage=true] I just couldn't see those parts of  her because the one-sided love I felt for her blinded me to all that.

I don't know what I was thinking. [r]
Love, real love, the kind of love shared between two human beings, should never be equated  to the kind of relationship between that of an author and a reader. [r]
I made this story and expected Miyabe-san to embrace it, to love me through the work. The moment she failed to "understand" it, I turned against her. [r]
But if she did embrace this work, could what we have had really be called love? [r]
A loving relationship is meant to be one that's equal. A life-long partnership where both sides  are of equal standing in the relationship and free to communicate directly with each other,  rather than through a one-sided medium.[hr repage=true]
An author creates a one-sided work for their reader, and that reader can only exalt the author and place them on a pedestal of worship. That's the kind of love I wanted, but such a love isn't an equal one. It's more so a "relationship" between a creator and a consumer. [r]
Can such a relationship really be categorized as love? I don't think so.

The only reason why anything happens in this world is because I desired it to be that way. [r]
The original story was written in such a way that the only possible takeaway a person could have from it was that to be a good, righteous person, they would have to love, understand, and care about me. [r]
If they couldn't understand me, then that was due to their own failings, rather than my own. [r]
That was the entire reason why I wrote this story. To make someone I don't even truly know  care about me. [r]
And that's why I brought Miyabe-san to this world against her will. To force her to experience this story directly and to put her through the plot points of my story, so I could deceive her into caring about me. [r][hr repage=true]
And yet, despite my desperate need to get Miyabe-san to understand me, I never went out of  my way to understand why she rejected this world I created.

This world that I've created is a time capsule of who I was before I entered it. [r]
If I allow this work to continue to exist, or if I release it to the wider world, then this flawed version of myself will continue to be perserved forevermore. [r]
All of my scars, all of my hubris,  all of my fears, all of my anxieties will live on in this concrete form. [r]
I don't want that. I'd much rather this work I've made fade into non-existence. The same goes for this journal I'm writing. [r]
If either of these works are immortalised, I'll only end up becoming shackled to them. [r]
I have to destroy them. And yet, even now, my heart aches at the thought of destroying  what I've created. Even though I hate it, even though it's a tool of deception, it's still my creation. [r]

No. I can't let this fear get the better of me. [r]
I've made up my mind. I need to bring this story to an end. [r]
I'm the one who brought Miyabe-san to this world, so it's my responsibility to return her home safely. [r]
I'll have to find a way to meet up with her again somehow. I have no idea where she is. [r]
Once I've reunited with her, I'll push this story towards its final plot beat at the promontory, so that the two of us can return home together. [r]
After that, I'll tear up the original copy of the Strange Dawn story, and it will be as if it never existed. As for this journal, I plan to leave it behind in this world. Once the Strange  Dawn story is destroyed, everything that's left behind in it will cease to exist. [r][hr repage=true]
In fact, there's no point in me even writing in this thing anymore. [r]
Goodbye.

My previous entry into this journal was meant to be my last one, but here I am writing in it again.[r]
I fully intend this to be my true last entry into this journal. [r]
As I'm writing this entry, I'm currently waiting for the Griania forces to find Miyabe-san  and bring her back to Belzerg. [r]
This village is our meeting point. Once we meet up again, I'll have to push the Griania army towards taking us to the promontory. [r]
In the original story, the protagonist brings down the Stonehenge monument at the promontory and grabs onto the gem at the center of that place. She's surrounded by the characters she met along the way. [r]
In order for us to both return home, the two of us need to recreate this plot point.[hr repage=true] I don't  think it'll work with just one of us, and even if it did, I have no intention of leaving  Miyabe-san behind or staying in this world myself.[r]

Since my last journal entry, I've been thinking everything over. There wasn't much else I  could do in the downtime while I waited for the Griania forces to find Miyabe-san. [r]
My thoughts and feelings on all of this hasn't changed that much since my last entry. I still don't like what I've created. [r]
However, there is one addendum to my thoughts that I'd like to add. [r]
Despite everything, I don't regret writing this Strange Dawn story. [r]
The most important thing that the writing of this story and journal has brought me is a development in my personality. [r]
Before I wrote the Strange Dawn story, I was a coward so petrified that I couldn't reach  out to other people. [r][hr repage=true]
This cowardly nature of mine hasn't entirely went away, but it has definitely lessened somewhat as a result of me writing this story. [r]

This is what I believe all fictional works should be made for: personal development. [r]
Rather than creating for fame, or for adoration, or to be remembered, or to entertain  others, or to make a change in the world; one should create for the sake of their own  personal development as a human being. [r]
Works of fiction are inorganic tools akin to a death mask. These works should not be propped up or take precedence over life and humanity. [r]
The biggest mistake I made was treating the fiction I created like it was a replacement for  myself.  [r]
A work of fiction can never replace a human life, nor can it be a substitute for things like love. [r]
Me and Miyabe-san don't belong here. [r][hr repage=true]

My plans haven't changed. I'll leave this journal behind and escape this place with Miyabe-san. [r]
Once we've returned to reality, I'll tear up the Strange Dawn story I've made, and all the fictional shells left behind in this world will cease to exist. [r]
I don't know if I'll continue to write stories once I return to reality. [r]
I don't feel like I have anything left in me to write. [r]
I have a life; there's nothing I can write or sculpt or draw that will be more precious than that.  [r]
For the first time ever, I want to live. [r]
And never in all my life have I felt more determined to do just that.

I exit the cavern. [np]
I understand everything now. [np]

Why is this world so fragmented? [nl]
The answer is clear:[l] Eri tore up  the original story. [l]Just as her  journal had missing pages, this  world too has missing pages. [np]

Why does the world look like  this? [nl]
It's on the verge of dying. [l]Eri  may have tore up the original  story, but it still exists in some form out there in the real world. [np]However, the form it exists  in is breaking down. [np]

Where are all the other  characters? [nl]
They've ceased to exist. [l]All that  remains of them are the dotted  outlines of their remains littered  about this world. [np]

Why is it just me and Eri in this  world? [nl]
We're the only characters left. [nl] We're the fictional shells of the  protagonists, so I can only assume  that the less important characters  went first. [np]
